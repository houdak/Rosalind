# Rosalind

I have only starting learning to code fairly recently, and in the process have been solving problems on rosalind.info .

Each problem on the website has a 3-4 letter ID. The title of each solution in this repository the ID corresponding to the relevant problem.
I also have two files named FileOperations and FrequentOperations which don't directly correspond to any particular problem
FileOperations has two functions which are used for loading the dataset given by the website, and writing the output to a separate file.
FrequentOperations has functions that are used in multiple problems.

I will continue to update this as I go along as a personal record of my progress :)
